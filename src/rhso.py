"""RHSO: Receding-Horizon State Optimization.

A reconstruction strategy of this repository (not a published method).  At every scheduled
time it optimises THE CURRENT GENERATIVE STATE against its own terminal consequence, then
executes a single scheduled interval and starts over:

    at s_k, from the current state x_k:

        anchor = stop_gradient(x_k)               <- FIXED for the whole stage
        q^(0)  = x_k
        for j = 0 .. M-1:
            fidelity = Phi( to_pixels( G_{s_k -> 1}( q^(j) ), differentiable=True ) )
            R        = sum_b 1/(2 d_b) || q^(j)_b - anchor_b ||^2
            loss     = fidelity + mu * R
            q^(j+1)  = AdamUpdate( q^(j), d loss / d q )
        q* = q^(M)

        x_{k+1} = G_{s_k -> s_{k+1}}( q* )        <- only ONE interval is executed

    then repeat at s_{k+1}, from a FRESH optimisation problem AND a FRESH anchor taken
    from the state actually reached.

The outer times are the repository's universal power-law schedule with N = num_rhso_steps:

    s_k = s_0 + (1 - s_0) * (k / N)^beta

What RHSO is NOT
----------------
* NOT D-Flow.  D-Flow optimises ONE state (the trajectory's starting point) against the
  terminal reconstruction and then executes the WHOLE planned trajectory.  RHSO throws the
  optimisation problem away after committing a single interval and re-optimises from the
  state it actually reached.  The closed-loop replanning is the method.
* NOT MPC.  MPC optimises an explicit control variable u that is added to the dynamics, and
  pays for it with a control penalty ||u||^2 and a lambda trade-off.  RHSO has no u, no
  control cost, no lambda and no K: the decision variable IS the state.  `mu` below is NOT
  MPC's lambda -- it weights a displacement of the STATE from where the trajectory actually
  was, not the magnitude of an added control signal, and the two are neither numerically
  nor conceptually interchangeable.

State-anchor regularisation (optional; mu = 0 by default)
---------------------------------------------------------
Pure terminal fidelity lets q drift arbitrarily far from x_k, and an over-optimised q can
score well on the measurement while leaving the generative manifold -- the observed failure
mode is measurement consistency continuing to improve while PSNR / SSIM / LPIPS degrade.
`mu > 0` adds a trust-region-like penalty on that displacement:

    R(q, x_k) = sum_b  1/(2 d_b)  || q_b - x_{k,b} ||_2^2

    (squared difference -> MEAN over the non-batch state dimensions -> times 1/2
     -> SUMMED over the batch)

The batch sum matches the repository's per-measurement fidelity convention, so one sample's
gradient never depends on the batch size, and the 1/d normalisation means a useful mu does
not scale with the state dimensionality (a pixel model and a latent model are comparable).

The anchor is the state at the START of the stage, detached, and it does NOT move as q
moves.  It is not the trajectory's origin x_0, and it is not a moving average.  Nothing
about the schedule, the planner, the execution step, the Adam reset or the cost accounting
changes: the penalty contains no model evaluation.  mu is an EXPERIMENTAL extension
motivated by observed over-optimisation, not a theoretical requirement.

Family differences (both are implemented; neither is a special case of the other)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STANDARD FLOW (JiT, SiT) -- two terminal planners, chosen by `rhso_terminal_mode`
    "suffix" (the legacy default): G_{s_k -> 1} is integrated -- a differentiable
    fixed-step solve over the REMAINING SUFFIX of the same outer grid,
    [s_k, s_{k+1}, ..., 1], with the repository's existing solver semantics (Euler / Heun /
    RK4 and the adapter's own final-step policy).  No second planning-resolution
    hyperparameter is introduced, and the planning cost shrinks as k grows.

    "direct": ONE call to the adapter's own direct clean-endpoint prediction
    x_hat_1(q, s_k).  For JiT that is the network's NATIVE output, guided exactly as
    `velocity` guides it (both go through the one `_guided_clean` implementation), and the
    remaining trajectory is never integrated.  x_hat_1 is an ENDPOINT PREDICTOR, not a
    learned family of finite-interval transport maps -- it is not pMF's T_theta with a
    different name.

    The EXECUTION rule is identical in both modes: one `flow_step` over [s_k, s_{k+1}].

MEANFLOW (pMF, iMF)
    The terminal planner is ONE direct learned finite-interval transition
    T_theta(q ; s_k -> 1).  No ODE is constructed, no instantaneous velocity is inferred,
    and the remaining outer intervals are NOT composed for the objective.  One forward and
    one backward network evaluation per inner iteration, at any k -- which is what makes
    MeanFlow models computationally well suited to a receding-horizon state optimiser.

Differentiability contract
--------------------------
The inner objective path

    q -> terminal planner -> native terminal state -> to_pixels(differentiable=True)
      -> A(x) -> fidelity

contains no NumPy conversion, no detach, no PIL and no stop-gradient.  For latent models
(iMF, SiT) the gradient continues through the VAE decoder; there is no separate pixel/latent
mathematics, only the adapter abstraction.  Model parameters stay frozen -- only q moves.

Execution is inference only: no graph is carried into the next outer stage, and the Adam
state is rebuilt from scratch at every stage because the optimisation problem itself
changes when the terminal transport map changes.
