"""The reconstruction-method registry: (dynamics family, method) -> reconstructor.

This module owns the GLOBAL dispatch and nothing else.  It makes no experimental decision,
holds no hyperparameter and knows nothing about any individual algorithm beyond its
signature; each strategy lives in its own module:

    sdedit.py   ordinary generation from z_t0            (the paired baseline)
    mpc.py      MPC-RHC and MPC-delta_t                  (trajectory control)
    pnp.py      PnP-Flow                                 (gradient / reproject / denoise)
    dflow.py    D-Flow                                   (source-state optimisation)

Every reconstructor has the same signature (see docs/extending.md):

    fn(adapter, cond, x0, problem, spec) -> (final native state, ReconstructionStats)

`x0` always arrives already built by `models.base.build_initial_state`, from the shared
epsilon, so the fairness invariant

    same problem + same model + same t0 + same epsilon
        ==>  the ONLY thing that varies is the reconstruction strategy

holds for every entry in the table below by construction rather than by convention.
