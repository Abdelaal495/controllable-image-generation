# Executable tests for PnP-Flow and D-Flow

Two scripts that run the reconstruction code against **synthetic analytic "models"** — no
checkpoint, no GPU, no download. They exist because the structural checks in `src/checks.py`
run inside a real experiment, and these can run in seconds on a laptop or a login node.

`test_meanflow_pnp_dflow.py` executes `pnp.meanflow_pnp` and `dflow.meanflow_dflow`
end to end against a toy MeanFlow adapter and checks: the `1 + N·M` denoiser accounting and
zero generative backprops; the correction schedule and step sizes; bitwise determinism;
that the reprojection noise does **not** move when `gamma0` does; that the fidelity actually
falls; that Adam reduces the D-Flow objective; that the returned reconstruction is the
trajectory of the **final** `q` rather than a stale iterate; that the gradient with respect
to `q` is finite and non-zero; and that the planner's cost model matches the measured
counters.

`test_flow_trajectory.py` executes the framework-neutral parts of the standard-flow paths:
`dflow._integrate_flow` for euler / heun / rk4 with and without JiT's final-Euler policy,
compared **bitwise** against an independent transcription of the reference integrator in
`sdedit.py`; the evaluation counts; the terminal gradient through a multi-step trajectory
and that a descent step reduces the loss; and the PnP schedule and per-image reprojection
noise.

`test_beta_schedule.py` needs nothing but the standard library and checks the universal
power-law grid: `beta` validation, exact endpoints, strict monotonicity, the worked
`beta = 0.5` / `beta = 2` examples, interval direction, PnP's times staying strictly inside
`(s0, 1)` for every `beta`, that `MPC-Δt`'s inverse-delta scaling uses the **local** `dt_k`,
and — most importantly — that `beta = 1` reproduces the pre-`beta` grid **bitwise**, against
an independent transcription of the original expressions.

`test_rhso.py` executes `rhso.meanflow_rhso` against toy MeanFlow adapters (one pixel-space,
one latent with a differentiable decoder) and asserts the *structure* rather than the
output: the recorded transition trace shows `M` direct `s_k → 1` planning calls and exactly
one `s_k → s_{k+1}` execution per stage; `lr = 0` degenerates the run to plain successive
execution, which is what proves `q` starts from `x_k`; the Adam state is verified fresh at
every stage against a reference (with the carried-moments variant shown to differ); the
counters match `N·M` and `N·(M+1)` and the planner's cost model; the result is deterministic
and distinct from D-Flow. The standard-flow parts that are not torch-specific — the planning
suffix, the evaluation counts, `flow_step`, and `integrate_flow` over a non-uniform suffix
compared bitwise against a reference integrator — are executed too.

It also covers RHSO's optional state-anchor regularisation `mu`: that `R` is zero at the
anchor and positive after a displacement, that its gradient equals `(q − anchor)/d` and a
descent step strictly shortens the distance to the anchor, that `R` is summed over the batch
and normalised by the state dimensionality, that the anchor stays bitwise fixed across a
stage's inner iterations while the displacement grows from exactly zero, that stage `k+1`
anchors bitwise to stage `k`'s **executed** state (not `x0`, not the optimised `q`), that a
larger `mu` really does hold `q` nearer the anchor, that every compute counter is identical
at `mu = 0` and `mu > 0`, and that a spec carrying `mu = 0.0` and one with no `mu` attribute
at all produce a **bitwise identical** result. Torch/JAX parity is asserted structurally —
both loops are shown (by scanning their bytecode, nested closures included) to call the one
backend-generic `rhso.state_anchor_penalty`, whose NumPy and JAX evaluations agree — because
`flow_rhso` itself cannot run here.

`test_rhso_theory.py` covers the direct terminal planner and the theory-validation
diagnostics. It executes a JiT-shaped toy standard flow (native clean prediction, guidance
applied to it, velocity **derived** from it) and the toy MeanFlow, and checks: that
`x + (1-s)·v` recovers the direct prediction at equal guidance cost; that direct planning
performs exactly one endpoint prediction with `integrate_flow` replaced by a tripwire, while
the legacy suffix planner still integrates; that `auto` resolves to each family's previous
planner and that a MeanFlow refuses `suffix`; that the one-interval execution rule and the
executed trajectory are bitwise unchanged with diagnostics on; that direct JiT planning costs
one evaluation per objective in the planner's cost model; that every algorithmic counter is
identical with diagnostics on and off while the JVP/VJP/eval/second counters fill separately;
that the matched-budget config yields exactly `(1,160) (2,80) (4,40) (8,20)` and 70 jobs with
the frozen learning rates; that `sum(per-sample fidelity) == batch fidelity` for all four
normalisations; that a batch of 4 with one padded row gives three distinct per-image rows per
stage; that `V_pre`/`V_post` match an independent re-run and `V_post` differs from the last
recorded inner loss; that the final stage's replanning fields are NaN rather than invented;
that the pMF consistency metric equals an independently computed predict/execute/re-predict
discrepancy and that the JiT metric is labelled `terminal_prediction_inconsistency` rather
than a semigroup defect; that the Jacobian probes are matrix-free, per-image isolated,
seed-deterministic and claim no condition number; that the stage and spectral arrays survive
`results.npz` round-tripping; and that the per-job process memory sampler resets while JAX's
lifetime high-water mark is never reported as a process peak.

`tests/spec_support.py` builds every spec through the **real** validator and planner: it
assembles a small in-memory configuration, runs `validate_config` and `resolve_run_plan`,
and splits overrides automatically between the configuration (where they are validated) and
`dataclasses.replace`. A test that runs at all has therefore already proved its method and
fields are properly declared. Both scripts also exercise the configuration directly — `beta`
sweeping into distinct job ids and directories, `delta` becoming null at `beta != 1`, RHSO
rejecting `lam`/`K`/`control_cost_normalization`/non-Adam optimisers, `mu` sweeping into
distinct job ids and output paths while leaving the cost estimate untouched, `mu` being
refused for every non-RHSO method, and the warm-up key separating beta- and mu-distinct
jobs. A documented stand-in remains as a fallback if
`src/config.py` cannot be imported at all; each script prints which path it used.

`test_cluster_and_aggregation.py` is the regression suite for the bugs found by the first
real Rorqual H100 smoke run. It needs neither JAX nor PyTorch and checks: that the
`_probe_spec` helper lets an explicit override win instead of raising
`dataclasses.replace() got multiple values ...` (and that the *old* form really did raise,
so the test proves the bug rather than assuming it); that the direct-terminal-planning
check's baseline probe disables all three theory diagnostics explicitly rather than
inheriting them from a theory config; that every mutable top-level file an array task writes
is shard-private, that `collect_finished_jobs` merges a 4-job x 4-image run into exactly 16
per-image rows with no duplicates, deterministic ordering and correct partial-completion
behaviour; that merged `checks.json` contains **both** model families and that a failure in
any one shard survives the merge; that merged `run_metadata.json` unions per-model
provenance and preserves each shard's complete payload; that the "REMAINING suffix" warning
appears for `suffix` jobs (including `auto` on JiT) and never for JiT-`direct`; that Rorqual
resolves to `cuda/12.9` + `cudnn/9.13.1.26` while **Narval's module line is byte-identical
to the previous behaviour** and never contains `12.9`; that `setup_cluster.sh` contains no
hard-coded `module load cuda` and installs `nvidia-ml-py` with a wheelhouse-first fallback;
that `src/memory.py` never calls `nvmlDeviceGetMemoryInfo` (checked by parsing its AST, not
by substring search, since the docstring forbidding it names it) and never fills
`gpu_process_peak_gib` from a framework counter; and that the four theory configs still
resolve to 4 / 70 / 10 / 10 atomic jobs with the matched-budget pairs and the two distinct
terminal-planner identities intact.

`test_theory_extensions.py` covers the two opt-in capabilities added for the six theory
experiments, and the six configurations themselves.

For the **paired measurement noise** (`measurement_noise_group`) it checks: that with no
group the built `y` is **bitwise** what an independent transcription of the original seeding
expression produces; that `(y − Ax)/σ` is identical across `σ ∈ {0.1, 0.2, 0.4}` inside one
group and that the shared draw really is standard normal; that a different group, and a
different image id, each re-draw independently while the other images keep their own `ε`;
that a different *structural* parameter (`blur_sigma` 1.0 vs 2.0) stays independent while
two `σ` at one blur width stay paired — i.e. only the noise **amplitude** is excluded from
the seed; that rebuilding a request reproduces `y` bitwise; that the mask is bitwise
unchanged with and without a group, so the feature touches the noise seed and never the
operator; and that the group and the recipe actually used are recorded in the problem
metadata.

For the **gradient-aligned authority** diagnostic it checks against a closed form — a linear
terminal map `P(x) = Dx` with a quadratic fidelity, where `A = ‖Dᵀg‖/‖g‖` is known exactly —
that the two norms and the ratio match analytically (max relative error ~3e-8), that the log
field is the log of the ratio, that an image scores the same alone as inside a batch of
three (per-image isolation), that `real_rows` truncation keeps padded rows out, that the
probe is deterministic, that its cost lands only in `diagnostic_model_evals` /
`diagnostic_vjps`, and that a vanishing endpoint gradient yields the documented **NaN**
while both norms stay on the row. It then runs `rhso.meanflow_rhso` end to end with the flag
on and off and asserts the executed states are **bitwise identical**, that every algorithmic
counter matches, that the diagnostic counters and clock fill only when the flag is on, that
there is exactly one populated row per (image, stage), and that the default run records
nothing at all. Serialisation is checked by round-tripping the new `[image, stage]` arrays
through a real `.npz` **without** `allow_pickle`, and by showing the summary averages skip a
`NaN` row instead of propagating it.

For **backward compatibility** it asserts both fields default to off, that a spec predating
either field resolves to the old behaviour, that
`configs/experiments_theory_validation_final100.yaml` still resolves to 70 jobs with the
four matched pairs and unchanged job ids and leaf directories, and that turning the new flag
on in one experiment block moves **exactly** that block's 2 job ids while the other 68 are
untouched — so a partially-completed sweep keeps its results.

For the **six new configurations** it pins each one's job count, uniqueness, models, methods
and image count, and then the scientific content of each: that Experiment 1 is D-Flow with
`steps=4`, 160 iterations, Heun and the validated JiT learning rate; that 2A's six pairs all
satisfy `N·M = 160` and are not a 36-job Cartesian product; that 2B holds `M = 40` while `B`
runs 40 → 640; that the noise sweep carries one pairing group across four `σ` that remain
four distinct problem instances; that the `mu` sweep is log-spaced including 0 at both
`(4,40)` and `(8,20)` with the loss-history split enabled; that `beta` moves the stage times
in the documented direction (`s₁ = 0.5000` at `β=0.5`, `0.2500` uniform, `0.0625` at `β=2`)
and that `delta` is null off the uniform grid; and that Experiment 6 enables both
diagnostics on exactly the jacobian config's settings, images and probe seed while keeping
the old jobs' identities disjoint.

`test_benchmark1000_manifest.py` checks the 1000-image frozen benchmark
(`benchmarks/imagenet1000_c42_i43`) without touching the network: 1000 rows, every class
0–999 exactly once, ranks in 0–49, distinct mirror rows, no overlap with the tuning pool
(`cache/data/imagenet_val_100`, reconstructed by rule when it is absent) with the exclusions
and re-draws recorded in the plan, unique self-describing filenames whose synsets match
`benchmarks/imagenet_class_index.json`, the 100-image manifest's columns and no filename in
common with it, and that `scripts/make_frozen_selection.draw` regenerates both this plan and
the 100-image one — so the two benchmarks provably share one selection procedure.

## What these tests do NOT cover

The toy adapters are not the real models, so nothing here says anything about
reconstruction *quality*. More specifically:

* **JiT-direct is not executed end to end here.** `rhso.flow_rhso` and the real
  `JiTAdapter` both need PyTorch. What is covered for that path is structural: the shared
  `make_terminal_planner` factory is executed against a JiT-shaped toy adapter, and
  `JiTAdapter.velocity` / `JiTAdapter.clean_prediction` are shown by bytecode scan to be
  wrappers around one `_guided_clean` with no duplicated guidance. The torch glue itself is
  checked on a GPU by `run.py --check`, which now runs `rhso_direct_terminal_planning`
  against the loaded model.
* `pnp.flow_pnp`, `dflow.flow_dflow` and `rhso.flow_rhso` are **not** executed — they call
  `torch.autograd.grad`, `torch.optim.Adam` and `torch.no_grad`, which need PyTorch. Their
  trajectory arithmetic and counters are covered indirectly (the integrator above and the
  MeanFlow twins), but the torch glue itself is not.
* `src/memory.py`'s Torch and NVML paths need a CUDA device; on a CPU box the profiler
  reports `cpu_no_gpu_memory` and the columns stay empty.
* The VAE-decoder gradient path for latent models (SiT, iMF) needs a real checkpoint.

Run the real per-model checks for those: `python run.py --config ... --check` executes
`pnp_initial_projection`, `pnp_determinism`, `dflow_gradient` and `dflow_optimisation`
against the actual loaded model, and they are recorded in `checks.json`.
